         <p>The term "fashion brand" (or "fashion label") includes all the brands that operate within the fashion industry.[1] A fashion brand combines symbolism, style, and experiential elements, and it needs to differentiate its products and coordinate its supply chain to succeed in the market.[2][3] Consumers commonly employ brands as a means of expressing either their genuine identity or an idealized self-image that they aspire to achieve.[4][5][6]

            History
            Prior to the mid-19th century, clothing was mainly handmade for individuals, either domestically or by hiring dressmakers and tailors.[7] The origins of couture can be traced back to the mid-nineteenth century in Paris. Charles Frederick Worth pioneered haute couture by introducing high-fashion dressmaking. Currently, the concept has gained widespread acceptance. Chanel, Balenciaga, and Christian Dior are prominent fashion brands that offer haute couture lines. [8]
            
            However, with technological advancements and the rise of global capitalism in the early 20th century, factory production and retail stores, such as department stores, emerged, allowing for mass production of clothing in standardized sizes and fixed prices.[7]
            
            Global fashion brands
            The fashion industry is widely recognised as one of the most actively internationalising sectors within the retail industry.[9] A significant proportion of globally recognised fashion brands conduct the majority of their commercial activities beyond their country of origin.[9] International operations are the primary source of revenue for prominent brands such as H&M, Inditex, and Nike.[9] Nike's global success serves as a pertinent illustration of the significance of brand extensions in the growth of sport brands. Other prominent brands in this industry, including Adidas, Reebok, Puma, and Asics, have similarly embraced this trend by introducing new apparel and footwear offerings.[10]
            
            Categorization
            The fashion industry involves the design, production, distribution, marketing, retailing, advertising, and promotion of various types of clothing for men, women, and children. This includes both high-end designer fashion and everyday clothing, ranging from couture ball gowns to casual sweatpants.[7] The category of fashion brands displays a significant variation in terms of both price segmentation and product quality.[1][3]</p>
